🚦 Traffic Sign Detection using YOLOv8

A real-time Traffic Sign Detection System built using YOLOv8.
This project detects traffic signs from images, videos, and real-time webcam feed, and also includes a Streamlit-based web app for user interaction.

📌 Overview

This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify and classify traffic signs.
The model was trained for 20 epochs using a publicly available traffic sign dataset and deployed using Streamlit.

⭐ Features

Detect traffic signs in images
Detect signs in videos
Real-time detection using webcam
Powered by YOLOv8n (fast & lightweight)
Beautiful Streamlit UI
Includes training curves, mAP, precision, recall
High accuracy and real-time performance

🧪 How It Works

Input image/video/webcam frame

YOLOv8 processes the frame

Model predicts bounding boxes + class labels

Output rendered with detected signs
